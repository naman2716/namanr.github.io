                We utilize a dataset of cervical spine CT scans provided by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). This dataset comprises 3,000 studies of individual patients, used collectively for training and testing. Among these, 83 studies include segmentation data, and an additional number of studies contain bounding box coordinate data. The dataset is divided into 90% for training and 10% for validation. We employ EfficientNetV2 to learn the segmentation tasks and the YOLOv5 model to detect fractures and draw bounding boxes around the fracture areas.

              <p class="project-wrapper__text-info"> Autonomous driving technology stands at the forefront of revolutionizing the automotive industry, offering the potential to significantly enhance safety, reduce traffic congestion, and provide increased mobility to individuals. One of the most promising approaches to achieving fully autonomous driving capabilities is Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which enables vehicles to learn and adapt to complex and dynamic environments. This project aims to develop an advanced autonomous driving system leveraging DRL techniques, empowering vehicles to make real-time decisions and navigate safely and efficiently. By harnessing the power of DRL, we seek to create a robust system capable of addressing the challenges posed by real-world driving scenarios, ultimately contributing to the broader adoption of autonomous driving technology.

              <p class="project-wrapper__text-info">
                The Distributed File Management System uses blockchain technology as a secure and decentralized database to manage and store files, addressing issues like data tampering and unauthorized access. It employs a reverse tree structure for data integrity and comprises servers, nodes, and access points for robust storage and transfer. Built from scratch with custom blockchain architecture and a mixed cipher encryption protocol, the system ensures high data security and efficient connections over a private network. Future plans include supporting more file types, developing a user interface, and creating a mobile version, showcasing blockchain's potential in distributed file management.
